      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, single-page applications (SPA) have developed rapidly. From the early days of using JavaScript to write large amounts of &lt;code&gt;HTML templates&lt;/code&gt; for SPAs, to the current dominance of frameworks like React and Vue, the front-end ecosystem has advanced at an astonishing pace. It feels like new technologies emerge constantly, and without keeping up, it’s easy to fall behind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At its core, every new technology, when explored deeply, turns out to be more complex than it seems at first glance. Over time, however, some concepts start to make sense—this is the essence of &amp;ldquo;deeply understanding something to make it simple.&amp;rdquo; SPAs are inherently complex technologies, and many frameworks and tools have been developed to address these complexities, such as React, Vue, React-router, and Redux. For beginners, learning all these tools at once can be overwhelming. However, at a fundamental level, libraries like React and Vue are not drastically different; they are both solutions designed for SPAs. The main philosophy of these libraries is to divide web applications into reusable components. Each component can include other components to enhance reusability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
